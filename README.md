# ML_Vision-Transformer
This repository contains a Keras implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) image classifier, trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The code demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a ViT model using TensorFlow and Keras, including data augmentation, patch extraction, transformer encoder blocks, and model checkpointing.
